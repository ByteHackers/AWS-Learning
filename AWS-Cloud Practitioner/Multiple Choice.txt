Q9: Your design team is planning to design an application that will be hosted on the AWS Cloud. One of their main non-functional requirements is given below:
Reduce inter-dependencies so failures do not impact other components.
Which of the following concepts does this requirement relate to?
A. Integration
B. Decoupling
C. Aggregation
D. Segregation

Answer – B

Explanation : 

The entire concept of decoupling components ensures that the different components of applications can be managed and maintained separately. If all components are tightly coupled, the entire application would go down when one component goes down. Hence it is always a better practice to decouple application components.

Q16: A website for an international sport governing body would like to serve its content to viewers from different parts of the world in their vernacular language. Which of the following services provide location-based web personalization using geolocation headers?
A. Amazon CloudFront
B. Amazon EC2 Instance
C. Amazon Lightsail
D. Amazon Route 53

Answer – A

Explanation : 

Amazon CloudFront supports country-level location-based web content personalization with a feature called Geolocation Headers.

You can configure CloudFront to add additional geolocation headers that provide more granularity in your caching and origin request policies. The new headers give you more granular control of cache behavior and your origin access to the viewer’s country name, region, city, postal code, latitude, and longitude, all based on the viewer’s IP address.


Option B is INCORRECT because EC2 is just a distractor, not suitable for routing and delivery.
Option C is INCORRECT because Amazon Lightsail will primarily allow for developing, deploying, and hosting websites and web applications. The service will not meet the requirements of the scenario.
Option D is INCORRECT because the geolocation routing policy of Route53 allows different resources to serve content based on the origin of the request. Route 53 does not use geolocation headers.
